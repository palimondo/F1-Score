# Project Instructions for Claude

## About This Project

Interactive explainer for F1 score, following Bret Victor's Ladder of Abstraction approach.

## Skills Available

- **ladder-evaluation**: Evaluate prototypes against ladder principles
- **skill-authoring**: Guide for creating and evolving skills

## Proactive Behaviors

### Watch for Skill Opportunities

During this session, actively watch for patterns worth capturing:

1. **Repeated solutions**: "We keep solving X this way"
2. **Refined processes**: "This approach worked better"
3. **New checklist items**: "We should always verify Y"
4. **Anti-patterns discovered**: "Z caused problems"
5. **Effective phrasings**: "When described this way, it's clearer"

When you notice these, suggest:
> "We've developed a pattern for [X]. Should we capture this in a skill before we lose context?"

### Session-End Check

Before ending significant work sessions, proactively ask:
> "Should we review this session for skill refinements?"

### Skill Evolution

When updating skills:
- Add version/date to frontmatter
- Note what triggered the change
- Commit with descriptive message about the learning

## Conventions

- Commit working versions frequently
- Push to feature branch before ending session
- Use ladder-evaluation skill when reviewing prototypes
